WordPress MVC
=============

MVC Framework written to work on top of WordPress theme

## IMPORTANT
### This is currently in beta and being tested on real sites. The code is subject to change at anytime. Consider Tags as the only stable version of this code. Once there is a tag for a version > 1.0 this will then become updatable and may be considered stable.

To Turn features on and off, add file mvc-config.php to your theme, copy the code from the mvc-config located in the plugins root and make your changes to the theme file.


More useful readme and documentation coming soon. Up until 9/4/13 this was a private project used on many live 
WordPress sites. It is being made public in hopes of helping other developers out there who love MVC.
