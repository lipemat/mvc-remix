MVC Theme - WordPress Plugin
==============================

MVC Framework written to work on top of WordPress theme

## Plugin is currently in BETA
As of version 0.2.1 things are looking good and stable but more testing is a good idea. This will now update from the Github releases automatically using the standard WordPress plugin updates.



##Usage
To Turn features on and off, add file mvc-config.php to your theme, copy the code from the mvc-config located in the plugins root and make your changes to the theme file.

More useful readme and documentation coming soon. Up until 9/4/13 this was a private project used on many live 
WordPress sites. It is being made public in hopes of helping other developers out there who love MVC.
